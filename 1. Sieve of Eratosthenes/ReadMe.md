# Sieve of Eratosthenes : 

Seive is an Algorithm is used to find prime numbers efficiently. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is the most popular and widely used seive. 

The classical Sieve of Eratosthenes finds the primes upto number N in time complexity of about O(N log (log N)) and is quite easy to implement. But there exists the modified version that calculates primes in time complexity of about O(N). Both implementations are given in C++.

# P.S. :
This code is compartmentalized hence you can use this in your own programs as a function. Just remove all the comments and you'll have an function that efficiently finds all prime numbers upto give limit.
